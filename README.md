## Problem 1 - share a short-term document, email, phone, address, or other personal informaation

It's a common problem to quickly & easily connect with someone.

A few examples:
1. You're on the phone with your doctor and need to share a senesitive document.
2. You're on social media and want to share your email, phone number, etc.

## Solution:

A "repository" of information and files. You can create short-term shares with a password and expiry date (or limited number of access). You can do this in just a few clicks to then share with someone.

The workflow will be:
1. Click "New Share"
2. Select checkboxes of data listed (pre-filled information, uploaded documents, text, images, etc)
3. Select a password from a list of prefilled passwords (we'll use news headlines so the passwords are long, complex, but easy to communicate). 
4. Select an expiry date or number of times the share can be accessed.
5. The app will the display the shareable link. This will be along the lines of http;//connect-us,io/share/united or http;//connect-us,io/share/bicycle or http;//connect-us,io/share/oak-tree. I.E. the shortened url will be a word to, again, easily communicate. 

## Problem 1 - create a short-term communication list/platform
Let's say I'm organizing a BBQ so I want to communicate with everyone attending the BBQ. I could create a text group but that gets unweildy and is hard for a person to "unsubscribe". I could create an email group but no one uses email groups and reply-all's are stupid.

## Solution:
What if I could create a connection list and send a link to everyone invited. Those people could then "sign up" to be on the email list or not. Messages posted to the list would also be displayed on the landing page for the list. Users could sign up to receive email, text, FB Messenger, WhatsApp, etc. messages so it becmoes a central place to distribute messages to many platforms.
And, when the event is done the list is "destroyed" and there's no additional digital cleanup needed.
