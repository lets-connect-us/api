## Problem:

It's a common problem to quickly & easily connect with someone.

A few examples:
1. You're on the phone with your doctor and need to share a senesitive document.
2. You're on social media and want to share your email, phone number, etc.

## Solution:

A "repository" of information and files. You can create short-term shares with a password and expiry date (or limited number of access). You can do this in just a few clicks to then share with someone.

The workflow will be:
1. Click "New Share"
2. Select checkboxes of data listed (pre-filled information, uploaded documents, text, images, etc)
3. Select a password from a list of prefilled passwords (we'll use news headlines so the passwords are long, complex, but easy to communicate). 
4. Select an expiry date or number of times the share can be accessed.
5. The app will the display the shareable link. This will be along the lines of http;//connect-us,io/share/united or http;//connect-us,io/share/bicycle or http;//connect-us,io/share/oak-tree. I.E. the shortened url will be a word to, again, easily communicate.
